## 1 Contribute for the first time

# 1.0 Read and agree to the License
ADRD is licencend under GPL-3.0. Make sure that you agree with this licence before contributing to the project.


# 1.1 Fork the project

Fork the project to your GitHub.
Then clone the forked project to your computer:
git clone 

# 1.2 Create a new branch

The recommended name of the branch contains the name of the feature you are working on. For example I am writhn a "How to contribute" document and I will use "howto-contribute" for the name of my branch:
git branch howto-contribute
Then switch to your branch:

git checkout howto-contribute

# 1.3 Do your changes
Do your changes in the repository. For instance add a new code, fix a bug or modify the README. Then set the upstream to:

git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/main howto-contribute
Add the file/code that you created/modified:

git add name-of-the-file
Then commit the changes with a meaningful comment:

git commit -m "A meaningful comment here please"
1.4 Push your branch
Push your branch to your GitHub fork:

git push origin howto-contribute

# 1.5 Create a pull request

After all this you will see a "Compare and pull request" green button in your GitHub. Click on it and make a miningful pull request by adding a title, the reason for your commit and a link to the issue (if you are resolving an issue).

At this stage you are done and you have to wait for the approval of your pull request.

## 2 For later Contributions
# 2.1 Sync your fork (not necessary for the first time)

Always sync your fork with the origin repository. You can do it on GitHub or in the command line:

# Add a new remote upstream repository
git remote add upstream 

# Sync your fork on your device
git fetch upstream
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# Sync your fork on your GitHub repo
git push

# 2.2 Do your changes and create a pull request
Do not forget to switch to your desired branch before doing any modifications:

git checkout howto-contribute
Then, repeat the steps 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 from the previous section.
